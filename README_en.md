## Introduce

Encapsulate some functions that are frequently used or needed in daily development into libraries,<br/>
Prioritize the production of single-file versions for quick integration into other projects.<br/>
They are not uploaded to pypi. In most cases, these libraries are mainly provided for my own use.<br/>
And in some projects, some libraries require additional adjustments.

Typically, I use some of the syntax and features of the latest version of Python,<br/>
Of course, some libraries are supported for use in older versions of Python,<br/>
You need to carefully check the minimum version supported by the corresponding library.

If you need to use them, you can add them to your project, Hope they can help you.
